**Session Summary (July 3, 2025):**

During this session, the following tasks were performed:

1.  **Import Path Corrections:**
    *   `src/pages/register.astro`: Corrected `Layout` import path.
    *   `src/pages/e/[eventSlug]/t/[tableSlug].astro`: Corrected `BaseLayout` and `EventData` import paths.
    *   `src/pages/e/[eventSlug]/seating-plan.astro`: Corrected `BaseLayout` and `EventData` import paths.
    *   `src/pages/e/[eventSlug]/index.astro`: Corrected `BaseLayout`, `EventData`, `GuestData`, and script import paths.
    *   `src/pages/dashboard.astro`: Corrected `Layout` import path.
    *   `src/pages/events/new.astro`: Corrected `Layout` import path.
    *   `src/pages/login.astro`: Corrected `Layout` import path.
    *   Files `src/pages/api/events/[eventSlug].ts`, `src/pages/api/events/[eventId].ts`, `src/pages/api/events.ts`, `src/pages/api/logout.ts`, `src/pages/api/login.ts`, `src/pages/api/register.ts`, `src/pages/404.astro`, `src/pages/e/[eventSlug]/landing.astro`, `src/pages/index.astro`, and `src/pages/invite/[inviteCode].astro` were reviewed and found to have correct import paths.

2.  **Styling Consistency:**
    *   Applied consistent Tailwind CSS styling to `src/pages/register.astro`, `src/pages/login.astro`, and `src/pages/events/new.astro` to match the existing design patterns (e.g., background gradients, form group styling, input fields, and buttons).
    *   Applied consistent Tailwind CSS styling to `src/pages/dashboard.astro` and `src/pages/e/[eventSlug]/edit.astro`.

3.  **Functionality and Feature Review:**
    *   **Host Flow:** Reviewed and confirmed functionality for Registration, Login, Logout, Dashboard, Create Event, and Edit Event. Fixed minor HTML structural issues in `src/pages/register.astro`, `src/pages/login.astro`, `src/pages/dashboard.astro`, and `src/pages/events/new.astro`.
    *   **Guest Flow:** Reviewed and confirmed functionality for Invite Code handling (fixed a bug in `src/pages/invite/[inviteCode].astro` where `eventSlug` was used before being defined), Event Home page, Table Page, and Seating Plan.

4.  **API Error Handling:**
    *   `src/pages/api/register.ts`: Added `try...catch` block to handle `SyntaxError` (e.g., "unexpected end of JSON input") when parsing the request body, returning a `400 Bad Request` for invalid JSON.

5.  **Build Attempt & Error:**
    *   An attempt was made to build the project using `npm run build`.
    *   The build failed with a `EACCES: permission denied, mkdir '/home/gjtiquia/.config/astro'` error, indicating a potential sandbox permission issue preventing Astro from creating a configuration directory. This issue needs to be resolved externally to successfully build the project.
